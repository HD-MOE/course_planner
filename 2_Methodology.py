#### Use Case 1: Student Exploring Career Options and Course Eligibility
   - **Scenario**: A student is interested in STEM fields but isn‚Äôt sure which specific career or education path to pursue. They are also uncertain about the eligibility requirements for courses in these fields.
   - **Process**: The student enters their interests and strengths (e.g., proficiency in Maths and Science) into ECG Agent. Based on this input, ECG Agent suggests career sectors like Engineering or Information Technology and lists relevant courses in these fields at the selected polytechnics and ITE, along with the necessary subject prerequisites and minimum grade requirements.
   - **Outcome**: The student gains clarity on suitable career sectors and receives specific course recommendations with clear eligibility criteria. This allows them to focus on the prerequisites needed to qualify, providing a structured plan for their academic efforts.

#### Use Case 2: Educators Using ECG Agent as a Guidance Toolkit
   - **Scenario**: A teacher is responsible for providing basic educational and career guidance to a group of students but has limited time for researching course options and prerequisites across different institutions.
   - **Process**: The teacher uses ECG Agent as a toolkit to quickly access relevant course information, eligibility requirements, and career sector recommendations. The tool provides structured, data-driven guidance, cutting down the time the teacher would otherwise spend on manual research.
   - **Outcome**: The teacher can efficiently deliver accurate and personalised guidance to students, helping them explore suitable career paths and educational opportunities without needing extensive preparation time.

#### Use Case 3: ECG Counsellors Supporting In-Depth Career Guidance
   - **Scenario**: An ECG counsellor is working with students who need detailed guidance on aligning their strengths and interests with suitable career and educational paths.
   - **Process**: The counsellor uses ECG Agent to access personalised course recommendations, career sector options, and eligibility details based on each student‚Äôs profile. By using the app, the counsellor can focus on providing deeper, individualised advice rather than spending time gathering information manually.
   - **Outcome**: Students receive well-researched, personalised guidance from the ECG counsellor, allowing the counsellor to spend more time on meaningful discussions and strategic advice tailored to each student‚Äôs unique profile.

#### Use Case 4: Parents Supporting Their Child‚Äôs Career and Education Planning
   - **Scenario**: A parent wants to help their child explore future educational and career options that align with their interests and strengths. The parent is looking for guidance on course options, prerequisites, and potential career paths but is unfamiliar with current educational pathways.
   - **Process**: The parent uses ECG Agent to enter their child‚Äôs interests and strengths, such as proficiency in the arts or a strong interest in science. ECG Agent then provides a list of recommended career sectors, along with suitable courses at polytechnics and ITEs, including prerequisites and any skills the child may need to develop.
   - **Outcome**: The parent gains insights into their child‚Äôs possible educational and career options and becomes more informed about the necessary steps for qualification. This helps the parent have meaningful, supportive discussions with their child about future planning and identify specific academic areas or skills the child may need to focus on.
